**-- Project Status: Completed**

## Installation
To use this project, first clone the repository onto your local machine using the following commands:

git init

git clone https://github.com/CalebMcCurdy/Flight-Status-Classification.git

## Project Intro/Objective

For those who live in the United States, flying is one of the main transportation options. People may discover that the likelihood of a flight being delayed or canceled varies depending on the airport you depart from, the time you fly, the airline you use, etc. We utilize the EDA approach to learn each factor's impact on the flight and the classification method to predict the flight status in order to gain a better understanding of the factors connected to flight cancellation and delays.

## Project Description
Our dataset for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/flight-delay-dataset-20182022. The data is in a .csv format with a size too large for upload, but can be downloaded from the aforementioned source. The original dataset, before reduction, contains 5,689,512 entries with 61 total columns for each. Only 19 of these columns will be kept for use throughout the project. We perform modeling predictions based on both flight cancellations and delays. Two models used are Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boost Estimator. Finally, we evaluate each model for the specific target variable we are attempting to classify.
